The Behavior of Exchange Rates (1 of 2)

‚Ä¢ What models can predict how exchange rates behave? ‚Äì In last chapter we developed a short-run model and a

long-run model that used movements in the money supply.

‚Äì In this chapter, we develop two more models, building on the long-run approach from last chapter. ‚Äì Long run means a sufficient amount of time for prices of all goods and services to adjust to market conditions so that Add their markets and the money market are in equilibrium.

‚Äì Because prices are allowed to change, they will influence interest rates and exchange rates in the long-run models.

(1 of 3)

‚Ä¢ The law of one price simply says that the same good in different competitive markets must sell for the same price, when transportation costs and barriers between those markets are not important.

‚Äì Why? Suppose the price of pizza at one restaurant is $20, while the price of the same pizza at an identical restaurant across the street is $40.Add ‚Äì What do you predict will happen? Many people will buy the $20 pizza, few will buy the $40 one. (2 of 3)

‚Äì People would have an incentive to adjust their behavior and prices would tend to adjust until one price is achieved across markets (across restaurants).

(3 of 3)

‚Ä¢ Consider a pizza restaurant in Seattle and one across the border in Vancouver.

‚Ä¢ The law of one price says that the price of the same pizza (using a common currency to measure the price) in the two cities must be the same if markets are competitive and transportation costs and barriers between markets are not important.

Add PUS = level of average prices in the U.S.

PCanada = level of average prices in Canada

EUS$/C$ = U.S.doller / Canadian doller exchange rate

‚Ä¢ Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that the exchange rate is determined by levels of average prices

EUS$ PUS C$ PCanada Add

‚Äì If the price level in the United States is US$200 per basket, while the price level in Canada is C$400 per basket, PPP implies that the C$/US$ exchange rate should be C$400 /US$200 C$2 /US$1.

‚Äì Predicts that people in all countries have the same purchasing power with their currencies: 2 Canadian dollars buy the same amount of goods as 1 U.S. dollar, since prices in Canada are twice as high. (3 of 3)

‚Ä¢ Purchasing power parity (PPP) comes in two forms:

‚Ä¢ Absolute PPP: purchasing power parity that has already been discussed.

Exchange rates equal the level of relative average prices across countries.

‚Ä¢ Monetary approach to the exchange rate: uses monetary factors to predict how exchange rates adjust in the long run, based on the absolute version of PPP.

‚Ä¢ To the degree that PPP holds and to the degree that prices adjust to equate the quantity of real monetary assets supplied with the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, we have the following prediction:

‚Äì The exchange rate is determined in the long run by prices, which are determined by the relative supply and demand of real monetary assets in money Add markets across countries.

(3 of 5)

Predictions about changes in 1. Money supply: a permanent rise in the domestic money supply

‚Äì causes a proportional increase in the domestic price level,

‚Äì thus causing a proportional depreciation in the domestic currency

(through PPP).

‚Äì This is same prediction as long-run model without PPP.

Add

2. Interest rates: a rise in domestic interest rates

‚Äì lowers the demand of real monetary assets,

‚Äì and is associated with a rise in domestic prices, ‚Äì thus causing a proportional depreciation of the domestic currency (through PPP).

(4 of 5)

3. Output level: a rise in the domestic level of production and income (output)

‚Äì raises domestic demand of real monetary assets, ‚Äì and is associated with a decreasing level of average

domestic prices (for a fixed quantity of money supplied),

‚Äì thus causing a proportional appreciation of the domestic currency (through PPP).Add

‚Ä¢ All three changes affect money supply or money demand, and cause prices to adjust so that the quantity of real monetary assets supplied matches the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, and cause exchange rates to adjust according to PPP.

(5 of 5)

‚Ä¢ A change in the money supply results in a change in the level of average prices.

‚Ä¢ A change in the growth rateof the money supply results in a change in the growth rate of prices (inflation). ‚Äì A constant growth rate in the money supply results in a persistent growth rate in prices (persistent inflation) at the same constant rate, when other factors are constant.Add

‚Äì Inflation does not affect the productive capacity of the economy and real income from production in the long run. ‚Äì Inflation, however, does affect nominal interest rates.

How?

The Fisher Effect (1 of 2)

Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates (1 of 2)

‚Ä¢ Suppose also that the inflation rate is in the United States before t0and after this time, but that the European inflation rate remains at 0%.

Add ‚Ä¢ According to the Fisher effect, the interest rate in the United States will adjust to the higher inflation rate. Figure 16.1 Long-Run Time Paths of U.S. Economic Variables After a Permanent Increase in the Growth Rate of the U.S. Money Supply

‚Ä¢ Differences in the measure of average prices for goods and services ‚Äì Levels of average prices differ across countries because of differences in how representative groups (‚Äúbaskets‚Äù) of goods and services are measured. ‚Äì Because measures of groups of goods and services are different, the measure of their average prices Add need not be the same.

‚Äì One price need not hold in two markets.

‚Ä¢ When expressed in terms of a single currency, countries‚Äô price levels are positively related to the level of real income per capita.

‚Äì A dollar, when converted to local currency at the market exchange rate, generally goes much further in a poor country than in a rich one.

‚Äì Figure 16-3 illustrates the relation between price levels Add and income, with each dot representing a different country.

‚Ä¢ Non-tradables tend to be more expensive (relative to tradables) in richer countries. (2 of 3)

‚Ä¢ The Balassa-Samuelson theory assumes labor productivity in poor countries is substantially lower than in rich countries for tradables but not for non-tradables.

Why Price Levels Are Lower in Poorer Countries

‚Ä¢ If the prices of traded goods are roughly equal across countries, the lower labor productivity in the tradables industries of poor countries implies lower wages, lower production costs in non-tradables, and thus lower prices of Add non-tradables than rich countries.

‚Ä¢ Productivity statistics support the Balassa-Samuelson differential productivity explanation. (3 of 3)

‚Ä¢ An alternative theory (by Bhagwati, Kravis, and Lipsey) relies on differences in the endowments of capital and labor, rather than productivity differences.

‚Ä¢ The higher capital-labor ratios in rich countries compared to poor countries makes the marginal productivity of labor and hence the wage level higher in rich countries. Add

‚Ä¢ Non-tradables are labor-intensive (use a higher ratio of labor to capital) relative to tradables, making non-tradables cheaper in poor, low-wage countries than they are in rich, high-wage countries.

‚Ä¢ Rich countries thus have higher overall price levels.

‚Ä¢ Because of the shortcomings of PPP, economists have tried to generalize the monetary approach to PPP to make a better theory.

‚Ä¢ The real exchange rateis the rate of exchange for goods and services across countries.

‚Äì In other words, it is the relative value/price/cost of goods and services across countries.

‚Äì For example, it is the dollar price of a European group of goods Add and services relative to the dollar price of an American group of goods and services:

‚Äì If the EU basket costs ‚Ç¨ 100, the U.S. basket costs $120, and the

nominal exchange rate is $1.20 per euro, then the real exchange rate is 1 U.S. basket per 1 EU basket.

‚Äì A real depreciation of the value of U.S. products means a fall in a Add dollar‚Ä≤s purchasing power of EU products relative to a dollar‚Ä≤s purchasing power of U.S. products.

‚ñ™ This implies that U.S. goods become less expensive and less valuable relative to EU goods.

‚ñ™ This implies that the value of U.S. goods relative to value of EU goods falls.

‚Ä¢ The real exchange rate is a more general approach to explain exchange rates. Both monetary factors and real factors influence nominal exchange rates:

1a. Increases in monetary levels lead to temporary inflation and changes in expectations about inflation.

1b. Increases in monetary growth rates lead to persistent inflation and changes in expectations about inflation.Add

2a. Increases in relative demand of domestic products lead to a real appreciation.

2b. Increases in relative supply of domestic products lead to a real depreciation. (8 of 10)

‚Ä¢ When only monetary factors change and PPP holds, we have the same predictions as before. ‚Äì No changes in the real exchange rate occurs.

‚Ä¢ When factors influencing real output change, the real exchange rate changes. ‚Äì With an increase in relative demand of domestic products, the real exchange rate adjusts to determine nominal exchange rates.

‚Äì With an increase in relative supply of domestic products, the situation is more complex. (9 of 10)

‚Ä¢ With an increase in the relative supply of domestic products, the real exchange rate adjusts to make the price/cost of domestic goods depreciate, but the relative amount of domestic output also increases.

‚Ä¢ The last equation is called real interest parity.

‚Äì It says that differences in real interest rates (in terms of goods and services that are earned or forgone when lending or borrowing) between countries are equal to the expected change in the value/price/cost of goods and services between countries.

(1 of 4)

1. The law of one price says that the same good in different competitive markets must sell for the same price, when transportation costs and barriers between markets are not important. 2. Purchasing power parity applies the law of one price for all goods and services among all countries.

Add ‚Äì Absolute PPP says that currencies of two countries have the same purchasing power.

‚Äì Relative PPP says that changes in the nominal exchange rate between two countries equals the difference in the inflation rates between the two countries. (2 of 4)

3. The monetary approach to exchange rates uses PPP and the supply and demand of real monetary assets.

‚Äì Changes in the growth rate of the money supply influence inflation and exchange rates.

‚Äì Expectations about inflation influence the exchange rate. ‚Äì The Fisher effect shows that differences in nominal interest rates are equal to differences in inflation rates.Add

5. The real exchange rate approach to exchange rates generalizes the monetary approach.

‚Äì It defines the real exchange rate as the value/price/cost of domestic products relative to foreign products.

‚Äì It predicts that changes in relative demand and relative

supply of products influence real and nominal exchange rates. Add

‚Äì Interest rate differences are explained by a more general concept: expected changes in the value of domestic products relative to the value of foreign products plus the difference of inflation rates between the domestic and foreign economies.
